        HowToUseRichTextBox.Text = "Follow these steps :" & vbCrLf & vbCrLf & "1. Open/Select sprite patch file." & vbCrLf & vbCrLf & "2. Enter suitable Start From value. [This value indicates the sprite number from where to start loading sprites.]" & vbCrLf & vbCrLf & "3. Enter suitable Count value. [This indicates how many sprites to be loaded including the starting sprite. Note: This should be kept small in order for the patcher to function faster.]" & vbCrLf & vbCrLf & "4. Enter suitable Global Palette Number value. [This value indicates the palette to be used to render each sprites. This is to speed up things and you can still make out all the sprites without correct palette.]" & vbCrLf & vbCrLf & "5. Left-Click on the sprites you want to select. Start from the first sprite of a group of sprites. [A group of sprites is the different views of a sprite, like the player has 20 sprites in it's group. You have to determine this group yourself. Make sure to select all the sprites in a group.] Selecting is not neccessary if you are good in Math! But just to ensure no false data it should be practised." & vbCrLf & vbCrLf & "6. Once you have selected all the sprites in a group just type the Selection Count [Number of sprites in that group.] in the first sprite of this group. [Note: This is important, sprite group count should be entered on the first sprite of that group itself.] Once entered press Enter on the textbox. Patcher should prompt you for confirmation." & vbCrLf & vbCrLf & "7. If you are a pro just cross-check the data given by the patcher and confirm the process. It's unlikely that patcher will do anything wrong, it must be you!" & vbCrLf & vbCrLf & "8. Now entry for that sprite has been added to your Patch File and automatically it's patch is writed to the current Rom!" & vbCrLf & vbCrLf & "9. Now repeat these steps till you reach the end, Good Luck!" & vbCrLf & vbCrLf & "10. If you have got anything wrong, like miscount don't worry just enter the correct count and process, since the patch file is processed step-by-step by the patcher so finally the correct patch will be automatically applied, until it's after the incorrect one and also in your current Rom since it is overwritten."
