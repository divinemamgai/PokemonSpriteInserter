FAQ
How to use this program?
First setup this program in your computer. Then make sure you have a Pokemon Fire Red Rom with JPAN's hacked engine.
Make a backup of your rom just to be safe in case anything goes wrong.
Know what you have to do i.e. What size of sprite do you need?, How frames does your sprite require? And What is the palette number of the sprite you are inserting.
Open your rom in the program, if it's a Fire Red Rom it will open. [Note: Currently there is no check for JPAN's Hacked Engine, so be sure of the rom you are using!]
If you don't want to go into any hassle with what values you need, just click Select Data Preset button which will show you pre-configured presets for sprites.
If the preset you want exists there, then just click that preset and click Done.
Once you have cross-checked everything, click Start Sprite Writing.
If everything goes Ok, the program will prompt you to choose table to insert new sprite in. If you are on JPAN's hacked engine just create a new empty table. This feature will be added soon so no need to worry.
To select the existing Fire Red Sprite table you need to change the Max Sprite setting in the Settings Menu other wise it will give you Error/Warning.
If you have an existing table with sufficient room, just select that table and if that goes well, voila you have just saved your self hours of hex editing in seconds!
If all this is still too much for you, I may create a simple video tutorial on how to use this program. But it should be straight forward for most of the people out there as of now.
What Not To Do?
While using custom offsets make sure there is enough free space lying around at that offset. You should know how much space is needed for each offset. Currently program won't check for space since it believes in you!
Before using this program for the first time, don't forget to go through settings! If you don't then it may break your rom but it will be your fault not the programs.
While using this for other roms don't just use the default presets! Other roms have different Pointers for Animations and other unknown ones.
Before being rude and saying that it break your rom please go through the settings you have used and what where valid for your rom. There is so much the program can validate as of now.
